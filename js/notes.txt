- try to add a new piece of art each day and place old in/on new page
    -try to organize the hell out of that code...
    
- ./ add the game of life somewhere small with a restart button and a full screen button
- use a single canvas to display the floating particles and the star field? not sure
- add latest project section ?
- add an ideas/thoughts section ?...
- incorporate a dark/light mode button
- I like the idea of the colors of the website changing depending on the time user visits site...
-Consider adding a navigation menu...but to what? to where?

- reconfigure all requestAnimationFrame calls to follow the correct time and update
- add feedback button and a form for contact

- add a clock somewhere? 
-set Calendar fields as todays date.
-consider where else to place or move the calendar. I'm glad I made it work but it probably should be so upfront for no
    reason. I have considered using it as a way to connect to an api to practice make api calls but so far haven't come
    across any interesting api's that aren't randomly generated. Even "fact" api's and history api's arent sorted by
    fucking date! What the hell is that? I guess I could design my own api...or maybe use Wikipedia?
    - an api sorted by date first, containing any inventions or discoveries known on that date.

-add more pages?
- add a digtally generated art page
